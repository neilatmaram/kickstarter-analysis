# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To show Louise how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I created a pivot table and filtered the data based on months of launch dates and outcomes for theater campaigns and created a graph. ![Theater Outcomes vs Launch Month](https://github.com/neilatmaram/kickstarter-analysis/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I filtered the data based on ranges for the goal amounts and outcomes for plays and created a graph graph. ![Outcomes vs Goals](https://github.com/neilatmaram/kickstarter-analysis/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge for me was labeling the *x*-axis with the ranges of the goal amounts. I was able to do this by conducting a Google search.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  The month that launched the most successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns was May. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  There is no relationship based on the goal and success of Kickstarter campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  There data is limited for campaigns with larger goals. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  A table and/or graph for musical campaign successes, failures and cancellations in relation to their fundraising goals.
